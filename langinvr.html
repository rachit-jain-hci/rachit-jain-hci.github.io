								<p>Learning languages is often tough because it is broken into parts- you learn how to write and how to speak separately. While there exist traditional classroom-based methods and mobile-based solutions, these are critiqued for being boring. Further, the spaces available to practice a language are inhabited by fear and hesitation of being incorrect. The motivation to learn a language is driven by the learner, and the systems they engage with do not provide for boosting motivation. We propose to make learning a language more interactive and engaging with an "Immersion" based Virtual Reality system.</p>

								<p>Using an immersive VR system, we make the process of learning a language playful, interactive and experiential. This system provides independence to the learners to learn and practice languages. It is a safe environment where learners can afford autonomy and can shed fears of being wrong. The learning system integrates reading, listening and speaking activities. We provide for learning through knowledge building and practicing. We leverage interactivity, spatio-visual learning and voice user interfaces to help people with the process of learning of a language and make it engaging.</p>

									<h3>Learning in VR</h3>
								</header>
								<p>We use a creation-based approach for learning, where objects appear when you invoke their names through speech in the language you want to learn. The creation of the object at successful pronunciation is an intrinsic feedback mechanism. Learning is hence supported with active feedback and delight on seeing objects appear at commands. We use a discovery oriented approach that encourages speech practice and voacbulary acquisition via repetition and knowledge transfer. The learning is further scaffolded through spatio-visual learning. </p>
								
								<header class="major">
									<h4>Vocabulary Acquistion</h4>
								</header>
								<p>The learner acquires new vocabulary through a list of objects and their translations. For each word, we provide the pronunciations, which can be heard to learn how that word is spoken in the new language. This facilitates retention and vocabulary acquisition. This method creates strong associations between a word, its translation, its pronunciation and the object created. This is boosted by the immersive context of a VR system.</p>
								
								<header class="major">
									<h4>Pronunciations</h4>
								</header>
								<p>The system provides for a natural voice user interface designed to faciliate learning and practice via repetition. The learner can simply speak up what object they want to create in the new language. If the pronunciation is acceptable, the object is created. If the pronunciation is not acceptable, the absence of creation notifies the learner that they need to practice more. </p>

								<p>The video demostrates the VR system in action. We use HTC Vive and the Unity engine to revamp the IBM Watson Speech Sandbox and provide language learners a highly interactive platform to learn a language. The setup consists of a Headset and mic mounted on the user, a physical space marked by HTC Vive lighthouses and, controllers with which the users interact with the virtual world. We augment immersion through the use of background sounds and music via earphones. </p>
